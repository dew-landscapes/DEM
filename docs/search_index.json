"],["intro.html", "2 Intro", " 2 Intro To model ecosystems, the terrain model should be able to distinguish changes in elevation in the order of a few metres above the surrounding area. For example in mallee, dunes a couple of metres high and 10s of metres wide often have different vegetation to the swales between the dunes. Swales can be 100s to 1000s of metres wide.

Table 3.1 lists the available DEMs. Table 3.1: Sample DEMs dem_name type original_cm licence ALOS DSM 2803 public ALOS DSM 2737 public ALOS DSM 2781 public ALOS DSM 2870 public Copernicus DSM 2803 public Copernicus DSM 2738 public Copernicus DSM 2781 public Copernicus DSM 2870 public Outback DTM 861 DEW only Ag DTM 1000 DEW only SRTM DTM 2803 public SRTM DTM 2738 public SRTM DTM 2781 public SRTM DTM 2870 public 3.2 Processing For each DEM, the following processing was applied: reprojected into GDA 2020 masked to the minimum available overlap between all DEMs (in each area) aggregated or disaggregated to roughly 30 m from original resolution reprojected into the same 30 m raster generation of derived rasters via: Qfit function in the MultiscaleDTM package (A. Ilich et al. 2024; A. R. Ilich et al. 2023, 2021) using v argument (window size): 3 cells land_class function in theenvRaster package (Willoughby 2025) using 3 cells for the small window and 11 cells for the large window as input to the 10 class landscape classification all values from the derived rasters used to generate a range of visualisations and summary statistics. The Qfit function generates several continuous and one categorical variable for a digital terrain model: elev qslope qaspect qeastness qnorthness profc planc twistc meanc maxc minc features` A shiny app is available to investigate the meaning of each of these variables.f 3.3 Workflow The data import, cleaning, analysis and report writing were done in a scripted workflow using the programs R and ‘R-studio Desktop’. R (R Core Team 2025) is an open source software environment for statistical computing and graphics. Base R can be extended via a range of open source packages to enable specific tasks or analyses. The packages used to produce this report are listed in Table 3.2. R-studio Desktop is a set of open source tools built to facilitate interaction with R.
